# Universe Viewer

Interactive software for the visualization and geodesic analysis of high-redshift astronomical objects.\
It makes it possible to produce a conformal mapping of cosmological structures, particularly quasars, taking into account the curvature of the universe.

Universe Viewer is intended to be a working tool for researchers in cosmology; it relies on concepts from astronomy and general relativity.
It must produce a conformal map of the universe and make it possible to identify large-scale structures in reference or comoving space.

# 6dF Galaxy Survey Final Redshift Release: VII/259

It has been converted to UniverseViewer data format using the `extract.py` script.

The following filtering has been made on original catalog:
- Radial velocity convertion to get redshift

The result has been compressed with:
```
gzip -c 6dfgs.dat > 6dfgs.gz
```

To run the conversion script, you have to download the `VII_259_6dfgs.dat.gz.fits` file from https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/VII/259#/browse URL.
